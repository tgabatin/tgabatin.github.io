## Introduction
Knight battle was a simple RPG game created in ICS 111, Intro to Programming. For our final project, we had the option to create whatever project we wanted, within the scope of using a simple programming language, EZ.Java.

## About
The game is similar to Japanese style RPG's. The main purpose of the game is centered around the story of a knight who needs to defeat a boss. The progression of the game changes as the main character gets stronger, so do the enemies. At the end of the game, a high score is recorded, which is the amount of time it took for the player to finish the game. 

## Learning Outcomes
This project was moderately difficult in terms of programming, as it was the first time that I've ever encountered a development environment that was not entirely my own. I learned to collaborate with another team mate, and work together to achieve a desired outcome. I also learned slightly about project management and object-oriented orientation, which would be a valuable asset in my journey as a programmer.
