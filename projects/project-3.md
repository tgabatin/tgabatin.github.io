## Introduction
This was a simple project created in ICS 111, Introduction to Programming. We needed to create a simple "paint" application that would take in the user input of mouse actions.

## About
The user is able to interact with this program, painting with a choice of colors given their selection on the keyboard, and a position of where to paint, given input from the mouse.

## Learning Outcomes
This project taught me more about user input and variables in Java. It also taught me about coding structure, and how to properly assign variable types, and work with documentation in programming.
