## Introduction
This was a project to be completed alone in ICS 111. The purpose of the game was to get us comfortable with object-oriented programming

## About
The project creates an object that automatically moves around the screen, given a variety of x and y positions. It must not collide within the walls and borders set. 

## Learning Outcomes
This project got me more comfortable with object-orientation, and learning how to get comfortable coding on my own. It also taught me more about functions and parameters within a program.
