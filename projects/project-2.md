## Introduction
This was a project to be completed alone in ICS 111. The purpose of the game was to get us comfortable with object-oriented programming. It allowed us to utilize multiple classes and methods, and implement them into a basic program that would auto execute. 

## About
The project creates an object that automatically moves around the screen, given a variety of x and y positions. It must not collide within the walls and borders set, and stay within the boundaries of the screen. The development required me to utilize the EZ Java library, and get comfortable using object-orienation.

## Learning Outcomes
This project got me more comfortable with object-orientation, and learning how to get comfortable coding on my own. It also taught me more about functions and parameters within a program. By learning how to program on my own and implement methods and functions, while utilizing object-oriented programming taught me how to recursively solve problems, and think backwards in terms of coding.
