##Swimming and HTML
When I was younger, and even to this day, my favorite sport is swimming. I enjoy pushing myself beyond the boundaries
of my body, and challenging myself to accomplish new records in time and advance my skillset in terms of this sport. The
concept of swimming embodies that of fear and bravery - it is not often you hear of those who are afraid of swimming; the fear
of drowning normally overwhelms the joys associated with floating. That is often why I felt so comfortable with swimming itself.
It was a leisure past time, and not often required much of my skill other than the fluid movement of my body against the tide.

##Semantic UI and Surfing
HTML(Hyper-Text Markup Language) was no different. I thought of it was a fun and easy concept to grasp - I was able to express
myself on the internet and create things with ease, and gave no second thought to the boundaries that I would have needed
to surpass in order to accomplish more when involving this language in web development. All seemed comfortable and well: then came
UI Frameworks. It reminded me of an all too nostalgic feeling brought about by my introduction to swimming. I was fine where I was.
Then came surfing.

HTML seemed a little boring and redundant at some point in the journey to web-development. The concept of placing objects
on a page for others to view little by little, and implementing various styling achieved through CSS seemed almost monotone
in comparison to the wonders of programming. I was hoping for some kind of solution to this redundancy, something that would alleviate
the problem of having to create all of these mark-ups on web pages every single time. Almost like I was introduced to surfing,
the introduction to UI Frameworks gave me the same feeling. It was just like HTML, but it made working with it a little more enjoyable,
simply because a new concept was introduced to me that I knew existed, but was never pushed to try. Never again will I create
a guess of how far I need to space pictures between each other to create columns and rows! Semantic UI frameworks already provide
me the elegance of doing so through their library! I need to create a login page? No more fiddling around with CSS to try to figure out
proper margins and placement, I can already do that with Semantic! It felt almost like surfing, no more did I have to sift through
the mundane properties of water; I could surf on the waves and enjoy a new thrill in life.

Now, that's not to argue that Semantic UI is not complicated, or that there is no learning curve associated with it. Often,
with anything new in life, like surfing, there is normally a strong uphill curvature when trying to learn something new, and I
definitely faced that problem when learning how to use these frameworks. Shuffling through the libraries to find the exact outcome that
I was hoping for was incredibly time consuming, and more often than not, I found more errors than solutions. But I would take the
learning curve over having to style each element in HTML and CSS individually on my own. Similarly, I would rather take the knowledge that I know now
of learning how to surf over having to dive underneath the water swimming to experience joy.

Just like learning how to navigate the seas on a surfboard, I'm excited to learn how to navigate through web development using UI Frameworks.
Who knows, maybe I'll end up exploring new methods of web-design using different frameworks.
