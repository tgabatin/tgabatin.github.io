## Javascript: A Language of Fluidity

When one thinks about versatility, they think about the fluidity of the given object or idea – in other words, the ability to adapt given the circumstances of external factors. In the coding world, Javascript and versatility are otherwise synchronous, holding a variety of purposes for the every day web-designer, or the average coder in college. 

Javascript has thus earned an optimistic reputation with myself; an intermediate programmer at best, a thought-provoking way to combine the knowledge I have with the desire and innovation to create. As the web grows, so is the ability to acquire new information, thus creating the desire to share new methods of problem-solving and creativity. I believe that because Javascript serves a multipurpose aspect in the language of coding, it will become easier for those within the world of technology to help others share their passions and creative content through the world of the internet. 

## Javascript vs. the World

If python is a snake and java is a cup of coffee, then let’s consider Javascript the multitool within the programmers arsenal. If you’re already comfortable with object-oriented programming, and some light understanding of how variables work in the global scope of a program, then the wonders of Javascript can either be a feature or a bug in the journey of code. 
  
On a personal level, I find Javascript quite enjoyable – the agitation of not needing to declare variable types, and the easy readability creates this language quite enjoyable to work with. The object orientation is also beginner-friendly, not being as arduous as C or C++, and not as demanding as Java. In other words, Javascript is a language for all types of coders alike. From the lens and perspective of a future software engineer, I believe that depending on the circumstances of the project, Javascript can either be your greatest asset or downfall. It’s true that I do consider it a multi-tool in the world of coding, but when I need the specifics of a toolkit, I will opt for the language that provides me the most powerful and specific tools to attain my desired outcome. Javascript in that aspect then, will be a supplier of that outcome, but not the primary tool.


## Athletic Software Engineering: Light Weights, More Reps; Heavy Weights, Less Reps
	
Just as an athlete must train day-in and day-out to improve, so do the programmers within the scope of technology. Given this training, practice does not often yield perfection, but instead perspective, for a different challenge towards our coding journey will require a different viewpoint of how to approach the given problem. By training ourselves to think differently about the solution, and how the outcome yields the results, we are more inclined to become not only adequate problem solvers, but active competitive thinkers.
  
Being an athletic programmer allows us to adjust our training towards our goals – whether we wish to diversify our skills, or focus on a particular field of interest. The one thing I love about athletic programming is that this style of learning focuses not only on the programmer versus our competitive candidates, but realistically, ourselves now versus who we wish to become as a software engineer. It is not often that one can reflect on themselves and recognize that they are not capable of something simply because their skillset is not where they wish to be. By training ourselves and putting ourselves under challenges of stress and pressure, we influence ourselves to not be a victim of our circumstance, but instead an active participant of the choices we make to attain our goals, whether we reach them or not. Although the discomfort of not knowing how to do something is difficult, I believe that through difficulties champions are created – thus athletic programming has the ability to strengthen the skills of anyone who is willing to accept the challenge, whether they are a competitive professional, or a budding student.
