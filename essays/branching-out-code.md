## Trees: Not only for your Binary Structure

Growing up in Hawaiâ€™i is a privilege. As a youth, I have always been influenced with the concept of taking care of the land, given the resources we are given; however, I was also very fascinated with science, and being able to understand how the world of fantasy and science-fiction we create in our minds can conceptualize in reality through the process of computational theory and algorithms. Not often do you see these two opposing fields combine, yet given the recent issues regarding climate change and sustainability, I find it imperative that scientists alike attempt to implement new methods and technologies that will change the ways we think about our planet, and as a result, plan for it. 

## Start at the Root, Traverse to the Next Node

Whenever I look at anything in nature, I try to understand how all of these things are connected, the most simple being a tree. As of the moment, I am at the root node of this tree in my growth as a future developer. The tree of possibilities is endless, and branching out to a focus seems daunting when presented with a plethora of options. Although I found myself often times confused as to where my path with computer science would take me, it was the basic concept of how trees grow that sparked my interest of the collaboration between computer science and nature. 

My love for algorithms therefore blossomed from this notion, and I began to partake in understanding how to solve complex problems by breaking them down into their simplest components and analyzing the data that would optimize the results. I want to learn how to use data science, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to therefore optimize the solutions to the problems the planet face regarding environmental impact. 

## One Step Back, and Three Leaps Forward

In todays modern society, many people focus on making a change without thinking about the possible consequences of their actions. I hope that through innovative and transparent technology, paired with the ethical decision making of our own creations, we are able to build a sustainable future for all living organisms alike. 

Through software engineering, I hope to gain the skills necessary to create and develop environments that would aid in the fight to win our planet back. Whether it be web-design to bring awareness to the issue, an online game that shows the effect of our every-day lives on the planet, or an app that brings out the transparency of the products and companies that we invest in, I believe that the knowledge learned in software engineering can help accomplish these personal goals.

## The Unspoken Algorithm

The most important algorithm to me in computer science; however, is not discussed in any textbook, or data structure, and it is something that I wish to constantly develop in the future, and that is the concept of imagination. I hope that through every node I pass, every branch I traverse, and every leaf I encounter through this tree of knowledge will bring me the teachers and colleagues alike to challenge me, the knowledge and information I need to push forward, and the creativity needed to imagine an ethical and sustainable world through technology.
