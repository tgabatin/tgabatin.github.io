## Write It On Paper
Software Engineering. That term was relatively new to me the moment I stepped into my ICS314 class a couple of months ago. I generally understood that becoming a software engineer was one of the job prospects available after graduation, but did not understand precisely what it was that software engineers did. In fact, that was one of the first questions my professor asked our class when we first embarked on this journey. Aside from the general answer of "software management", and "programming", we learned over the course of the semester that software engineering was so much more. More importantly, we learned that software engineering, programming, and anything in the department of computer science took a much more important aspect that was not fundamentally taught in classes. The by-product of becoming a successful software engineer is passion. All the tools and software, regardless of how well we managed them, were useless unless we manifested our passions into technology. That first day, we wrote our passions down on paper. And to this day, I still have it posted on my wall, reminding me to combine my passions with programming.

## Learning Software Engineering
In the time span of 3 months and a half, there were a plethora of topics covered in software engineering - some of which stuck out more than others. Open Source Software Development, Functional Programming, and Design Patters in particular stood out to me as programmer, because I thought these three topics would be fundamental in my journey as an aspiring developer. These programs generally become the base of me moving forward as a developer, and gaining a thorough understanding of these topics will help me advance.

Open Source Software Development was interesting to me, because of the way developers can work together on source code, by making it available to the general public. This means anyone who knows how to use developer tools are generally able to participate in building a project, or people can reference various source code to use in their projects if needed. Design in the program structure can be changed to adhere to the standards of the project, and a variety of people, all of which house different skillsets can come together and work on the open source project together. As a student, I can use this to my advantage, and learn from the open source available on platforms like GitHub, or online.

The second topic covered in Software Engineering was functional programming. At first, this topic was relatively difficult to me, considering the parameters of functional programming were methods that returned either a function or a value. I was used to the standard of object-oriented programming, where a value is passed into parameters, and in return, would return another value. Functional programming was difficult to me, because of the way you had to keep track of not only the variables present within a given method, but the return values of an actual method. The concept of passing in methods as parameters were not only new to me, but required me to practice more to this day. Although functional programming is not present in all programming languages, it is still a valuable asset that I wish to get better at beyond the scope of this class.

The final topic covered in software engineering that I thought was useful beyond the scope of web development are design patterns. Although this topic was covered late into the semester, I think that it's useful beyond the scope of web development, because it deals with the data structures in object-oriented design. Depending on the outcome of the potential program, design patterns can come in useful when creating the structure of basis of a program, and what its initial and final product will look like it. Since certain problems in software design may be recurring, or some solutions to the problems presented in software are difficult to solve, design patterns provide a generalized way of solving the problem using methods implemented in the past. By getting a greater understanding of how I can use these design patters in my programming, it will make it easier to create tangible solutions in my code that I can carry on beyond this class.

## The Final Level of Software Engineering
When asked in the beginning of the semester what my passion was, the word that I wrote down on paper was "Learning". At the end of the semester, reflecting on this answer, I still believe that it is a passion that I will continue to take beyond software engineering and development. By taking a step into the world of software engineering, and learning the technology associated with it, I believe that I can continue to grow as a developer, and create new things that aspire me to continue to learn more each day.
