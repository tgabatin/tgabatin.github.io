## The Paranoia Sets In
I'm going to be blunt and say that this virus sucks. It's quite the norm for many of us to be thinking this - it's affected a lot of us in our own ways. Particularly for myself, I've entered a new state of paranoia; as if my anxiety wasn't bad enough. Every time I cough, I start to google "symptoms of coronavirus" and WebMD myself into thinking I have it. It's scary to feel vulnerable, and weak, especially when a couple of weeks ago, we were all telling each other "see you after spring break!". Now there's really no guarantee if we will - some of my peers will be graduating, while others have decided to move back home for the time being. 

## Quarantine is the New Status Quo
It's not like I even did anything before this quarantine set in. Most of my life consisted of me sitting in front of a computer, whether it be coding, playing games, or simply watching a video, I was quite used to staying home or cooped up for long amounts of time. I actually find it quite relaxing, while others wish to get out, this is simply an extended vacation for me. It's unfortunate that I lost my job, but I'm taking this as an opportunity to learn. I now have extra hours in the week to pickup old hobbies, learn new things, and even get creative with home work outs! It's interesting to see a ton of videos on Instagram of people motivating others to do the same. I also have so much more time to spend with my dogs! It's nice to know that we don't have to social distance from our pets, I think that it's made things so much easier in terms of coping with this.

Now, it's not like I'm trying to be a negative Nancy out here, but there are OBVIOUSLY major drawbacks to this virus. One of the biggest being I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO STREAM OF INCOME. How will I pay my bills? I'm not that afraid of going out, it's my only way to stay sane, but every time I go out, or in the rare event that I do, I have to reset my symptom list - as in I self quarantine for 14 days before knowing that I'm in the safe zone. Distance Learning? Good luck with that, I guess distance learning for a lab is considered the new norm. It's all very hectic, but this is what's expected of the coming months, so I should probably get used to it while I can.  

## Getting Used to It All
It will obviously not get any better in the coming weeks, and with a vaccine slowly on the way, with human trials still pending within the next year, it's hard to say when things will ever get back to normal. Still, learning to adapt is a viable and important skill, so I'll take the time to learn what I can and adjust accordingly. I hope that those who are struggling out there with this virus, and with the hardships that it brings can also make those adjustments to their lifestyle.
