## Good vs. Bad Questions: What's the Difference?

Many people can argue that there are no such things as an illiterate question. I believe that the term literate is used loosely in this sense: there can definitely be questions that make you ponder whether or not it's the question that is dumb, or the person asking it. Now we're not trying to define "dumb" questions to be rude, we're just simply stating that there are better ways to ask questions in order to formulate a better response, if not a better answer that provides adequate, thought provoking insight on what is being asked.  

The beauty of the online community is filled with a wide array and assortment of both of these types of questions; the art of distinguishing between the two depend on the person. In a world filled with opinion, bias, and loose information, it is important to be precise, accurate, and clear with your question, enough so that you know the outline of your answer before even receiving one. 

## Bad Questions come with Good Intent

Every question is formulated such that a response is given regardless of whether it is right or wrong. In the online community, it is important to understand this concept. In order to verify that the answer you are receiving is correct, you must first postulate whether or not the question you are asking can be answered clearly. Asking questions such as "I don't know what this" means does not offer insight into what is being asked, what context, and which part of "this" the asker is referring to. Such actions can only lead to vague explanations, leading to more questions, and less answers. This does not necessarily mean that the person who is asking the question does not know what they are talking about; this can be improved. The intent of asking a question simply means that the person wishes to learn -- what is important is that they learn how to ask the question as well.

## Good Questions come with Better Content

The difference between a good and bad question is whether or not the question can be answered without the need to ask questions about the question itself; in other words, it is not recursive in its definition. A good question will not circulate upon the clarity of itself, instead the answer will stem from the context of the question, and the question will otherwise be easy to answer, simply because the person who is asking the question knows the results they are looking for specifically.
