## Why Ethics
When someone thinks of ethics, they normally think about the moral implications of society; how should one behave given they have choices, and how do these choices affect them on an internal and external scale? Ethical practices are an essential component in all aspects of life, given we have the power to choose how to react to certain situations, whether they be on a personal, emotional, and physical scale. The practice of ethics extend beyond the stigma of being a personal issue, and is seen as the moral factor of many businesses today. Fields of work, such as law, medicine, and engineering all adhere to some sort of moral standard that involves ethics, but what about software engineering? As an emerging technological field, the ethical implications of software engineering are budding anew, and many students, colleagues, and professionals alike are still wandering the wasteland of what seems to be a prosperous field, with practical ethical standards.

##  Technology and Ethics? How Different Are They?
If I look at myself in the mirror, I believe that I would want to put the best version of myself out there. What I define that is, is someone who is honest, open-minded, and hard-working. I want to be able to apply that same mindset to the people I interact with, and of course, my future career. Ethical coding standards adhere to me then, as an important aspect of a career, with moral implications being just as imperative as the standard work ethic of a company. From studying the cases of where software engineering and ethical implications collide, it is easy to see that there are obvious factors that can be implemented in software engineering. One of the most important ethical case observed then, is that of responsibility, and the ability to make issues right when it is due.

## What Can Go Wrong in Software Engineering?
Coding away on a computer can often seem redundant to those on the outside looking in. No one sees the hours of hard work that software engineers place into an application, whether it be a bank database, the software used to control drones that drop packages off to houses, or even the way that stop lights work on streets. Software engineers are the shadows lurking in the dark of the engineering field, often overlooked as people who only write lines and lines of code to make things work.

In this field, there is a somewhat satirical saying that goes by "It's not a bug, it's a feature"! As funny as this statement goes, not all bugs are meant to be features - what if the "feature" that is being highlighted costs a bank database to crash, and the money of hard working individuals is lost to a hacker? Or what if the present that someone ordered off of Amazon goes to a different coordinate system on the map grid? And lastly, when engineering and software engineering collide, what if the stop light that you are driving to turns green on accident, and you end up in a fatal car crash? Many factors like these are the backbone of software engineering, and although often overlooked, can create serious implications and hazards in modern day society.

## How can Ethics Solve This Problem?
One of the standards of ethics, is to be honest. And honesty in practice, means being honest with yourself about your technical skills, and when to ask for help when needed, along with admitting you are wrong when proven. There are many ways to hide the errors in code, and many people often mask these as "features" when writing software. Some of these "features"; however, do not comply in accordance with the way that software is often intended to work. Although minor errors, such as glitching, or a bug in the system many occur, many more serious factors can also be considered when thinking about the practical implications of programming.

Ethics and software engineering is still a new concept, but that does not mean that it is less important than that of being a talented programmer. Although it is true that solving problems is an important issue in engineering, being able to solve these problems with an ethical standard is just as imperative, and can provide favorable results in the future of technology.
