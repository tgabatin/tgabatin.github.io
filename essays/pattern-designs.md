## Different Types of Design Patterns
Design patters are commonly seen everyday in our lives. From the way that we implement our daily tasks, to the automation of artificial intelligence in our lives, the patterns of design in technology can be seen as a standard to modern society. What most people do not see; however, is the patterns of design that lay out the foundation of code. What exactly will optimize a system, and in what case is this system going to reach its peak performance based on these designs? Various types of design patters exist to optimize performance, but it's ultimately up to the developer to determine which types of design to implement in the code.

The most commonly seen designs are based on a three tier system of creational, structural, and behavioral design, all of which are implemented differently through the structures of code. Based on the outcome of the performance of the software, and what the software is intended to do throughout its lifespan, the varieties of these design patterns will differ depending on what the goal of the project is. Some of the applications of these design systems are seen on revolutionized modern code, such as the user-interface design of what the users of applications see, to the databases that software engineers need to manage.

## The Importance of Design Patterns
When breaking down the different categories of design patterns, some of these patterns are seen as essential in the industry of software design. The most common four being factory, single, observer, and MVC. All of these design patterns have their strengths and weaknesses, and its important to understand how these design patterns can be used in a variety of projects that adhere to the structure of the client, and the general usage of those who are intending to use the software itself.

## Design Patterns and Personal Code
Learning about design patterns is different in undergraduate - we learn about databases and structures, and algorithms that can manage code and optimize it, but when applying it to design patterns, this is essentially new information. One of the most commonly seen design patterns that I have seen in my undergraduate career has been the factory design pattern, which requires the usage of object-oriented programming to optimize and design code. Many of these types of designs, such as returning the objects of multiple classes and objects were seen in my intro level classes, and required me to understand how object-orientation works, and how classes and the structures of these classes can be manipulated to create functioning software. When describing Singletons, one of the most commonly seen designs that I've implemented was in my mid-tier classes, where we create instances of a single object, that of which we could use on a global scale. The problem with this; however, is that it is accessed by everyone in the code, and this is not necessarily a positive aspect of software engineering, considering not everything within the scope of a code should be accessed.

## The Overall Design
Learning a little about design patterns in code has definitely shaped my understanding of how it can be implemented in software. By tinkering with different designs, the usability and function of the code can be changed depending on how engineers want the software to perform, and how clients and users alike can react to it.
