## The Standards Are Important

When one thinks about standards, they think about uniformity. The most important concepts regarding uniformity then, is the base understanding of everything that should be considered the norm. For example, I like to read, I think that it's a wonderful hobby, but what would make it less wonderful is if there was no uniformity throughout the text. If I were to read a book that had no structure; no backbone to the stories it supported, I would not be able to feel a connection between myself and the author.

## To Collaborate is to Create

Connections are important in code - especially in terms of collaboration. When one things about a connection, people think about ties and bonds. The most important thing then, about bonds, is the ability to connect. Creating connections is important, but upholding these connections can be quite difficult. Thankfully, due to coding standards across multiple platforms, these connections cannot easily be breached.

Simple coding standards within functional IDE's, such as ESLint used for the purposes of this class, and other coding standards that are adhered by alternative companies and methods are useful in creating a uniform method of code that creates collaboration between developers easier. Although conforming to the standards in a social society may be frowned upon in terms of creativity, I believe that coding standards in a work environment in fact enhances the creativity between collaborators. By focusing less on the fact that there may be syntax errors in the code, and by looking at a greater uniformed developer environment, software engineers alike can focus more on the creative aspect of their tools, as oppose to fixing simple errors that can be resolved by simply following the standards of coding.

By creating a coding standard that will become uniform throughout various programming languages, more adaptability between developers and engineers can allow them to focus more on the content they push, as oppose to the environment they work on.
